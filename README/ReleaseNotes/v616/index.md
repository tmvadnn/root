## Deprecation and Removal

### Ruby bindings

The ruby binding has been unmaintained for several years; it does not build with current ruby versions.
Given that this effectively meant that Ruby was dysfunctional and given that nobody (but package maintainers) has complained, we decided to remove it.


## Core Libraries


## I/O Libraries


## TTree Libraries
### RDataFrame
  - Optimise the creation of the set of branches names of an input dataset,
  doing the work once and caching it in the RInterface.

## Histogram Libraries


## Math Libraries


## RooFit Libraries


## 2D Graphics Libraries

  - Highlight mode is implemented for `TH1` and for `TGraph` classes. When
    highlight mode is on, mouse movement over the bin will be represented
    graphically. Histograms bins or graph points will be highlighted. Moreover,
    any highlight emits signal `TCanvas::Highlighted()` which allows the user to
    react and call their own function. For a better understanding see also
    the tutorials `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/hist/hlHisto*.C` and
    `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/graphs/hlGraph*.C` .
  - Implement fonts embedding for PDF output. The "EmbedFonts" option allows to
    embed the fonts used in a PDF file inside that file. This option relies on
    the "gs" command (https://ghostscript.com).

    Example:

~~~ {.cpp}
   canvas->Print("example.pdf","EmbedFonts");
~~~
  - In TAttAxis::SaveAttributes` take into account the new default value for `TitleOffset`.
